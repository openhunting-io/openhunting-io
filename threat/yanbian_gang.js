But what we did not see was that even cybercriminals in remote parts of the country\u2014Yanbian\u2014were successfully profiting from the Android\u2122 mobile banking customers in a neighboring country\u2014South Korea.\n\nWhat we have dubbed the \u201cYanbian Gang\u201d has successfully been siphoning millions from their victims\u2019 accounts since 2013. The hackers used fake banking and other popular apps to victimize more than 4,000 South Korean Android mobile banking customers throughout 2013 and 2014. They also used effective social engineering lures like \u201cThe Interview\u201d to bait victims into installing their fake apps.",
