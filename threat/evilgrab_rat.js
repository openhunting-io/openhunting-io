        "description": "(Trend Micro) Recently, we spotted a new malware family that was being used in targeted attacks \u2013 the EvilGrab malware family. It is called EvilGrab due to its behavior of grabbing audio, video, and screenshots from affected machines. We detect EvilGrab under the following malware families:\n\u2022 BKDR_HGDER\n\u2022 BKDR_EVILOGE\n\u2022 BKDR_NVICM\n\nLooking into the feedback provided by the Smart Protection Network, EvilGrab is most prevalent in the Asia-Pacific region, with governments being the dominant sector targeted. These are consistent with known trends in targeted attacks.",
