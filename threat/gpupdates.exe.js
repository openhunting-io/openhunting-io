The packing alone has led the droppers to be detected under generic AV detections but the subcomponents have low-to-no detections at this time.\n\nThe Zip2Secure configuration entrusts the distribution of the files contained therein to \u2018{{Distribute.exe}}\u2019, which places the files and silently registers the subcomponents with regsvr32.exe.",
