        "description": "(Novetta) A stark departure from the design pattern found in Romeo-CoreOne-base families, RomeoEcho is a RAT that uses a more interactive command shell format for command identification.\n\nWith the communications key established and the handshake complete, RomeoEcho\u2019s core activates the communications loop function. RomeoEcho is single-threaded and does not spawn a new thread for incoming connections. As a result, only one client can access a RomeoEcho-infected node at a time.",
