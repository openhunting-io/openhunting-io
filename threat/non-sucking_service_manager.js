Nssm.exe launches the Non-Sucking Service Manager program. This is not an essential Windows process and can be disabled if known to create problems. NSSM is a free utility that manages background and foreground services and processes. The program can be set to automatically restart failing services. The program also logs all progress in an Event Log, making it easier to identify applications that aren't behaving as they should.",
