        "description": "(Palo Alto) We analyzed dozens of samples during this analysis, which resulted in the identification of two separate campaigns \u2014 one in mid-to-late 2018 using Sakabota and the other in mid-2019 using {{Hisoka}}. Our analysis of the two campaigns revealed that Sakabota is the predecessor to Hisoka, which was first observed in May 2019. By analyzing both Hisoka and Sakabota as well as the additional tools identified in the aforementioned activity, we have determined that Sakabota is likely the basis for the development of all the tools used in these attack campaigns.",
