        "description": "(ESET) LiteDuke is a third-stage backdoor that was mainly used in 2014-2015. It is not directly linked to Operation Ghost, but we found it on some machines compromised by MiniDuke. We chose to document is mainly because we did not find it described elsewhere. We have dubbed it LiteDuke because it used SQLite to store information such as its configuration.",
