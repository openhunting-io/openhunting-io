        "description": "(Mandiant) CLOSEWATCH is a JSP web shell that communicates with a listener on localhost over a specified port, writes arbitrary files to the victim operating system, executes arbitrary commands on the victim host, disables proxying and issues customizable HTTP GET requests to a range of remote hosts. If the proper HTTP URL parameters are specified, CLOSEWATCH can create a socket connection to localhost on port 16998 where it can send and receive data using HTTP-like communications using chunked transfer-encoding. If the range parameter is specified, CLOSEWATCH can scan a range of IPs and ports using custom parameters.  This malware was observed at one of the earliest FIN13 investigations.  Although a sample has recently appeared on a public repository, this malware hasn\u2019t been observed during more recent investigations. While more than just a recon tool, CLOSEWATCH\u2019s range parameter provides FIN13 with another scanning capability.",
