The malware had a multi-staged structure that began with a malicious RTF document and ended with an in-memory DLL payload that communicated, via the WebDAV protocol, with a command and control (C&C) address from a legitimate cloud service provider (CloudMe.com). The name \u201cInception\u201d comes from the group\u2019s many levels of obfuscation and indirection it employed in delivering this payload.",
