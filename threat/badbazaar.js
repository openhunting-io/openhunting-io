        "description": "(Lookout) We named this malware family BadBazaar in response to an early variant that posed as a third-party app store titled \u201cAPK Bazar.\u201d Bazar is a lesser known spelling of Bazaar.\n\nLookout has since acquired 111 unique samples of the BadBazaar surveillanceware dating back to late 2018. Over 70% of these apps were found in Uyghur-language communication channels within the second half of 2022.\n\nThe malware primarily masquerades as a variety of Android apps, such as battery managers, video players, radio apps, messaging apps, dictionaries, and religious apps. We also found instances of apps pretending to be a benign third-party app store for Uyghurs.",
