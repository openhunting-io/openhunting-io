        "description": "(ESET) ESET researchers have discovered a previously unreported cyber-espionage framework that we named Ramsay and that is tailored for collection and exfiltration of sensitive documents and is capable of operating within air-apped networks.\n\nRamsay\u2019s architecture provides a series of capabilities monitored via a logging mechanism intended to assist operators by supplying a feed of actionable intelligence to conduct exfiltration, control, and lateral movement actions, as well as providing overall behavioral and system statistics of each compromised system. The realization of these actions is possible due to the following capabilities:\n\n\u2022 File collection and covert storage\n\u2022 Command execution\n\u2022 Spreading",
