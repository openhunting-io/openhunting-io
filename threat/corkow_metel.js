        "description": "(Group-IB) In February 2015 the first major successful attack on a Russian trading system took place, when hackers gained unsanctioned access to trading system terminals using a Trojan resulting in trades of more than $400million.\n\nThe criminals made purchases and sales of US dollars in the Dollar/Ruble exchange program on behalf of a bank using malware. The attack itself lasted only 14 minutes, however, it managed to cause a high volatility in the exchange rate of between 55/62 (Buy/Sell) rubles per 1 dollar instead of the 60-62 stable range.\n\nTo conduct the attack criminals used the Corkow malware, also known as Metel, containing specific modules designed to conduct thefts from trading systems, such as QUIK operated by ARQA Technologies and TRANSAQ from ZAO \u201cScreen market systems\u201d. Corkow provided remote access to the ITS-Broker system terminal by \u00abPlatforma soft\u00bb Ltd., which enabled the fraud to be committed.\n\nIn August 2015 a new incident related to the Corkow (Metel) Trojan was detected. An attack on a bank card systems, which included about 250 banks which used the bank card system to service cash withdrawals from Visa and MasterCard cards under a special tariff. This attack resulted in the hundreds of millions of rubles being stolen via ATMs of the systems members.",
