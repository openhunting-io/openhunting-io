It includes a Lua 5.1 interpreter, which allows the spyware to execute Lua scripts and change its behavior at runtime.\n\nThe experts discovered that EvilBunny is able to receive commands from the C&C server at least in three different ways, via HTTP, through a downloaded database file or as a scheduled task.\n\nThe EvilBunny malware was initially delivered through a malicious PDF document, exploiting CVE-2011-4369. Once compromised the target the malware is loaded onto the system and infects the PC with EvilBunny malware.",
