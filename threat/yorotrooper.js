We also observed YoroTrooper compromise accounts from at least two international organizations: a critical European Union (EU) health care agency and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). Successful compromises also included Embassies of European countries including Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. We assess the actor also likely targets other organizations across Europe and Turkish (T\u00fcrkiye) government agencies.\n\nInformation stolen from successful compromises include credentials from multiple applications, browser histories & cookies, system information and screenshots.",
