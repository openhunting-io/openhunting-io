        "description": "Locky is a high profile ransomware family that first appeared in early 2016 and was observed being active until end of 2017. It encrypts files on the victim system and asks for ransom in order to have back original files. In its first version it added a .locky extension to the encrypted files, and in recent versions it added the .lukitus extension. The ransom amount is defined in BTC and depends on the actor.",
