        "description": "(Arbor) This post takes a look at a new banking malware that has, so far, been targeting financial institutions in Latin America\u2014specifically, Mexico and Peru. Initially, we\u2019ve called it \u201cMatrix Banker\u201d based on its command and control (C2) login panel, but it seems that \u201cMatrix Admin\u201d is a template available for the Bootstrap web framework. Proofpoint calls it \u201cWin32/RediModiUpd\u201d based on a debugging string from an earlier sample.\n\nThe malware is under active development, but as with some of the other banking trojans we\u2019ve analyzed, it\u2019s difficult to assess how far and wide this threat will go while it\u2019s still so new.",
