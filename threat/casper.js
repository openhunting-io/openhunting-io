        "description": "(ESET) Casper was used against Syrian targets in April 2014, which makes it the most recent malware from this group publicly known at this time. To attack their targets, Casper\u2019s operators used zero-day exploits in Adobe Flash, and these exploits were \u2013 surprisingly \u2013 hosted on a Syrian governmental website. Casper is a well-developed reconnaissance tool, making extensive efforts to remain unseen on targeted machines. Of particular note are the specific strategies adopted against antimalware software.",
