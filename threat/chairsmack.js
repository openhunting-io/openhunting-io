        "description": "(Mandiant) CHAIRSMACK is a backdoor written in C++ that communicates using HTTP. CHAIRSMACK's core functionality involves expanding its capabilities by retrieving plugins from a C2 server. Downloaded plugins are cached on disk for future use. Capabilities added via plugins are inferred based on supported backdoor command names. These capabilities include shell command execution, screenshot capture, audio capture, keylogging, file transfer, and file execution.",
