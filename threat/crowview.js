        "description": "(Mandiant) {{BIRDWATCH}} is often referred to collectively as \u201c{{JSSLoader}}\u201d; however, multiple variations of BIRDWATCH exist which we track as separate code families. One variant of BIRDWATCH is CROWVIEW, which is also .NET-based, but has enough code differences from prototypical BIRDWATCH that we cluster it separately. Unlike BIRDWATCH, CROWVIEW can house an embedded payload, can self-delete, supports additional arguments and stores a slightly different configuration.",
