        "description": "(IBM) Unlike other malware operated in Brazil, CamuBot is a defined new code. Very different from typical banking Trojans, CamuBot does not hide its deployment. On the contrary, it is very visible, using bank logos and overall brand imaging to appear like a security application. It thus gains victims\u2019 trust and leads them to install it without realizing they are running an installation wizard for a Trojan horse.\n\nCamuBot is more sophisticated than the remote-overlay type malware commonly used in fraud schemes targeting users in Brazil. Instead of simplistic fake screens and a remote access tool, CamuBot tactics resemble those used by Eastern European-made malware such as {{TrickBot}}, {{Dridex}} and {{QakBot}}, each of which focuses on business banking and blends social engineering with malware-assisted account and device takeover.",
