        "description": "(Accenture) HyperStack, first observed in 2018, is one of several RPC backdoors Turla uses. A sample identified in September 2020 has updated functionality which appears to be inspired the RPC backdoors previously publicly disclosed by ESET and Symantec Researchers as well as with the Carbon backdoor. Based on these similarities, we assess with high confidence that HyperStack is a custom Turla backdoor.",
