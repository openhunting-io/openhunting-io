        "description": "(FireEye) While the NETEAGLE backdoor does not have as venerable a history (identified samples were compiled as early as 2008 and as recently as 2013), it shows a similar pattern of long-term refinement and modification, including the development of two main variants (which we call the \u201cScout\u201d and \u201cNorton\u201d variants). Just as with {{Backspace}}, while the details of implementation and specific features across NETEAGLE samples may vary, the core functionality remains the same except for the addition of features or enhancements.",
