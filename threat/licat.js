        "description": "(johannesbader) Murofet, also called LICAT, is a member of the {{Zeus}} family. It uses a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to determine the current C2 domain names. There exist at least three different versions of Murofet\u2019s DGA, some of which I couldn\u2019t find reimplementations online. In this short blog post I list the three variants that I looked at and discuss the properties of each. Although all versions share a similar algorithm, the resulting domains are very different.",
