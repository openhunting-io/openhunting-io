        "description": "(Malwarebytes) Egregor ransomware is a relatively new ransomware (first spotted in September 2020) that seems intent on making its way to the top right now. Egregor is considered a variant of Ransom.Sekhmet based on similarities in obfuscation, API-calls, and the ransom note.\n\nAs we\u2019ve reported in the past, affiliates that were using {{Maze}} ransomware started moving over to Egregor even before the Maze gang officially announced they were calling it quits.",
