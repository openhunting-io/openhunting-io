SeaDuke is made interesting by the fact that it is written in Python and designed to be cross-platform so that it works on both Windows and Linux.\n\nThe only known infection vector for SeaDuke is via an existing {{CozyDuke}} infection, wherein CozyDuke downloads and executes the SeaDuke toolset.\n\nLike {{HammerDuke}}, SeaDuke appears to be used by the Dukes group primarily as a secondary backdoor left on CozyDuke victims after that toolset has completed the initial infection and stolen any readily available information from them.",
