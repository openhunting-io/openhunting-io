        "description": "(Lookout) Lookout researchers are monitoring the evolution of an Android surveillanceware family known as JadeRAT, we believe may be connected to a government sponsored APT group.\n\nJadeRAT supports over 60 commands that can be issued in the format !<command_id>&<optional_cmd_params>@. Many of these offer standard information gathering functionality seen in typical mobile surveillanceware, however JadeRAT supports several less common capabilities. These include notifying an operator via SMS when a device has booted and silently dropping calls and texts to attacker specified numbers.",
