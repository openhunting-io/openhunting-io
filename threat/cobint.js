Its name is based on the association of the malware with the \u201cCobalt Group\u201d threat actor and an internal DLL name of \u201cint.dll\u201d used in some of the samples. The malware can be broken up into three stages: an initial downloader that downloads the main component, the main component itself, and various additional modules.",
