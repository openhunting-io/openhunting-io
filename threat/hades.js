        "description": "(Accenture) At this time, it is unclear if the unknown threat group operates under an affiliate model, or if Hades is distributed by a single group. Under an affiliate model, developers\u2019 partner with affiliates who are responsible for various tasks or stages of the operation lifecycle, such as distributing the malware, providing initial access to organizations or even target selection and reconnaissance. However, based on intrusion data from incident response engagements, the operators tailor their tactics and tooling to carefully selected targets and run a more \u201chands on keyboard\u201d operation to inflict maximum damage and higher payouts.\n\nIn addition, we identified similarities in the Hades ransom notes to those that have been used by REvil ransomware operators, where portions of the ransom notes observed contain identical wording. The differentiating factors in the ransom notes are the operators\u2019 contact information and the formatting of the ransom notes. While the ransom notes are similar, we do not have any evidence to suggest the threat groups or operations have any overlap at this time.",
