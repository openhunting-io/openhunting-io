NARWHAL SPIDER is the adversary name designated by Falcon Intelligence for the criminal operator of Cutwail version 2. NARWHAL SPIDER primarily provides spam services with a large customer base that has included malware operators such as {{Wizard Spider, Gold Blackburn}} (developer of TrickBot), affiliates of BAMBOO SPIDER (developer of Panda Zeus), and many others including URLZone, Nymaim and Gozi ISFB. The targets and payloads delivered through Cutwail spam campaigns are determined by the customers of NARWHAL SPIDER.\n\nCutwail has been observed to distribute Dyre (Wizard Spider, Gold Blackburn), Zeus Panda ({{Bamboo Spider, TA544}}) and much of the malware from {{TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen}}.",
