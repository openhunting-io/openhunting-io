The campaign is targeting what appears to be betting companies in South East Asia, more specifically companies located in Taiwan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. With moderate confidence, we can attribute the campaign to a Chinese speaking APT group, but unfortunately cannot attribute the attack to a specific group and are not sure what the attackers are after.",
