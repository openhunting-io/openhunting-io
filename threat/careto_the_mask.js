The name \u201cMask\u201d comes from the Spanish slang word \u201cCareto\u201d (\u201cUgly Face\u201d or \u201cMask\u201d) which the authors included in some of the malware modules.\n\nMore than 380 unique victims in 31 countries have been observed to date. What makes \u201cThe Mask\u201d special is the complexity of the toolset used by the attackers. This includes an extremely sophisticated malware, a rootkit, a bootkit, 32-and 64-bit Windows versions, Mac OS X and Linux versions and possibly versions for Android and iPad/iPhone (Apple iOS).",
