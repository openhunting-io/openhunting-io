        "description": "(Check Point) The functionality of the Aria-body loader has not changed significantly since 2017, but the implementation varied from version to version. This loader appears to be specifically created for the Aria-body backdoor.\n\nOverall, the loader is responsible for the following tasks:\n\n\u2022 Establish persistence via the Startup folder or theRun registry key (some variants).\n\u2022 Inject itself to another process such as rundll32.exe and dllhost.exe (some variants).\n\u2022 Decrypt two blobs: Import Table and the loader configuration.\n\u2022 Utilize a DGA algorithm if required.\n\u2022 Contact the embedded / calculated C&C address in order to retrieve the next stage payload.\n\u2022 Decrypt the received payload DLL ({{Aria-body}} backdoor).\n\u2022 Load and execute an exported function of the DLL \u2013 calculated using djb2 hashing algorithm.",
