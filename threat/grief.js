        "description": "(Zscaler) An early Grief ransomware (aka Pay or Grief) sample  was compiled on May 17, 2021. This sample is particularly interesting because it contains the Grief ransomware code and ransom note, but the link in the ransom note points to the {{DoppelPaymer}} ransom portal. This suggests that the malware author may have still been in the process of developing the Grief ransom portal. Ransomware threat groups often rebrand the name of the malware as a diversion.",
