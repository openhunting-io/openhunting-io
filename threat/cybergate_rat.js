        "description": "(Citizen Lab) The CyberGate implant comes with the same credential stealing capabilities as the infector, and is extended by routines to spy on Chrome and STEAM credentials as well. Also inherited from the infector, the implant owns the same anti-analysis routine protecting it from sandboxes and debuggers.\n\nBeyond the capabilities seen in the infector, CyberGate has a range of features that provide an attacker with a full spectrum of monitoring and remote control functionality.\n\nCyberGate capabilities include:\n\u2022 Collecting detailed information about the infected system\n\u2022 Activation and control of the webcam and microphone\n\u2022 Screenshot capture\n\u2022 Blocking user input (e.g. keyboard and mouse)\n\u2022 Control over processes, windows, applications, devices, drive, ports, TCP & UDP connections, the clipboard, registry keys and values etc.\n\u2022 Control over the filesystem\n\u2022 Download and execution of further binaries\n\u2022 Exfiltration via FTP\n\u2022 Collection of information on installed security products",
