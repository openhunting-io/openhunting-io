        "description": "(Kaspersky) What sets this stealer apart is its use of a simply but tricky technique dubbed \u201c{{Living off the Land}}.\u201d Hackers have used this popular tactic in the past to launch attacks based on legitimate files which are either common within the organization attacked, or are widely-used administrative tools. The legit files can be abused to perform malicious functions.\n\nFor Separ, that means using very short script and batch files, as well as legitimate executables, to carry out all of its malicious business logic.",
