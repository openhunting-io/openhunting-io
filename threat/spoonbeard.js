        "description": "(FireEye) In May 2019, a SPOONBEARD-packed {{SCRAPMINT}} sample was uploaded to VirusTotal. Based on several Mandiant incident response cases, we believe SCRAPMINT has been used by multiple actors to conduct POS malware operations including FIN6.\n\nBetween August and December 2019, we identified SPOONBEARD samples that delivered {{AZORult}} or {{VIDAR}} credential theft malware. It is plausible that FIN11 used these credential stealers; however, both AZORult and VIDAR have been sold on underground forums and are used by multiple actors.\n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, we identified SPOONBEARD samples that delivered {{SLOWROLL}} and {{JESTBOT}} respectively. SLOWROLL is a backdoor associated with TEMP.TruthTeller (aka Silent Group) post-compromise activity.",
