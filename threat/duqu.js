        "description": "(Wikipedia) Duqu is a collection of computer malware discovered on 1 September 2011, thought to be related to the {{Stuxnet}} worm and to have been created by Unit 8200. The Laboratory of Cryptography and System Security (CrySyS Lab) of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in Hungary discovered the threat, analysed the malware, and wrote a 60-page report naming the threat Duqu. Duqu got its name from the prefix '~DQ' it gives to the names of files it creates.",
