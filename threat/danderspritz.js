        "description": "(Check Point) DanderSpritz is a full-featured post-exploitation framework used by the Equation Group. This framework was usually leveraged after exploiting a machine and deploying the PeddleCheap \u201cimplant\u201d. DanderSpritz is very modular and contains a wide variety of tools for persistence, reconnaissance, lateral movement, bypassing Antivirus engines, and other such shady activities. It was leaked by The Shadow Brokers on April 14th, 2017 as part of the \u201cLost in Translation\u201d leak.",
