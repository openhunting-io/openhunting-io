Other details include:\n\u2022 Written in CC+;\n\u2022 Supports various communication protocols;\n\u2022 Has a file manager module, a remote shell, a non-UAC mode;\n\u2022 Able to uninstall itself;\n\u2022 Able to upload information from remote machines;\n\u2022 Able to download an execute files.\n\nResearchers believe that 5loys is not a part of Group 27. More likely, the user\u2019s profile has been hijacked by the group and used for their own purposes.",
