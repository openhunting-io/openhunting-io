        "description": "Despite that the RAT was designed to execute in the memory of the machine (thus evading detection by AV software), ASERT researchers obtained the RAT\u2019s source code and connected it to a GitHub profile of a user named 5loyd.\n\nOn the GitHub page, the RAT has been advertised as a fast and free Windows remote administration tool. Other details include:\n\u2022 Written in CC+;\n\u2022 Supports various communication protocols;\n\u2022 Has a file manager module, a remote shell, a non-UAC mode;\n\u2022 Able to uninstall itself;\n\u2022 Able to upload information from remote machines;\n\u2022 Able to download an execute files.\n\nResearchers believe that 5loys is not a part of Group 27. More likely, the user\u2019s profile has been hijacked by the group and used for their own purposes.",
