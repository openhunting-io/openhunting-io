        "description": "(Malwarebytes) Citadel is an offspring of the (too) popular {{Zeus}} crimekit whose main goal is to steal banking credentials by capturing keystrokes and taking screenshots/videos of victims\u2019 computers. Citadel came out circa January 2012 in the online forums and quickly became a popular choice for criminals. A version of Citadel (1.3.4.5) was leaked in late October and although it is not the latest (1.3.5.1), it gives us a good insight into what tools the bad guys are using to make money.",
