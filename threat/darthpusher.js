The actual adware is named \u201cYt Service,\u201d and the developer changed the package name to make it appear as if it was developed by Google. Of course, DarthPusher was not developed by Google, nor does Google have any stake in the program. But it\u2019s found on the Xiaomi Mi4 nonetheless, and users are forced to run it by default.",
