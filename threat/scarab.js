        "description": "(Symantec) A group of attackers, which we call Scarab, has been performing highly targeted attacks against particular Russian-speaking individuals both inside and outside of Russia since at least January 2012. In each campaign, the attackers typically target a small amount of individuals\u2014rather than enterprises or governments\u2014using economic, military, topical, or generic lures. On average, less than ten unique computers are infected per month and there is no indication that the attackers are trying to spread through the victim\u2019s local network, suggesting that Scarab\u2019s campaigns are extremely targeted in nature.",
