Some companies gave into extortion demands and paid fees so breaches would remain private.\n\n\u201cI came to an agreement with some companies, but the concerned startups won\u2019t see their data for sale,\u201d he said. \u201cI did it that\u2019s why I can\u2019t publish the rest of my databases or even name them.\u201d",
