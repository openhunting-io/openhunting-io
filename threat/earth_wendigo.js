With no clear connection to any previous attack group, we gave this new threat actor the name \u201cEarth Wendigo.\u201d\n\nAdditional investigation shows that the threat actor also sent spear-phishing emails embedded with malicious links to multiple individuals, including politicians and activists, who support movements in Tibet, the Uyghur region, or Hong Kong. However, this is a separate series of attacks from their operation in Taiwan, which this report covers.",
