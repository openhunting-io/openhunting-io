        "description": "(Bleeping Computer) While Red Alert is a new addition to the mobile banking scene, the trojan works similarly to past threats. The trojan waits in hiding until the user opens a banking or social media app. When this happens, the trojan shows an HTML-based overlay on top of the original app, alerting the user of an error, and asking him to reauthenticate.\n\nRed Alert then collects the user's credentials and sends them to its C&C server.",
