        "description": "(Cylance) The malware known as Disttrack is a destructive worm that targets a system\u2019s master boot record (MBR). Disttrack is also known as Shamoon because the original payload included debugging information that referenced a programming database file with this unique name in the path.\n\nDisttrack\u2019s payload has spread in waves, mainly targeting Saudi Arabia\u2019s critical infrastructure, including, but not limited to: Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), and the Saudi Electric Company, leaving critical systems unusable. It is relentless, stealthy, and persistent as it waits in the shadows of infected computers as a Windows service and attacks on hardcoded dates, like a ticking time-bomb waiting to go off every 90 seconds.",
