        "description": "(securitykitten) ScanPOS, while not extraordinarily impressive or unique, is a new family. It performs the same basic tasks that all other POS malware performs, yet sneaks by almost every developed detection technique. ScanPOS does little in terms of evading detection, which can help it blend in a production environment. When code is heavily packed, it will often get picked up by generic heuristics.",
