        "description": "(Symantec) In 2011, organizations in South Korea were yet again targeted by DDoS attacks. Similar to 2009, a number of government and private websites were targeted, this time using a tool called Trojan.Koredos. This attack was unusual for a DDoS attack because it did not use a command and control (C&C) server; the commands were hidden inside the threat itself. The use of a tactic like this indicated a growth in sophistication from the group compared to the 2009 attacks. Symantec research into this threat also found that, as well as carrying out a DDoS attack, if the infected computers were not cleared of this Trojan the master boot record (MBR) of some of them would be destroyed within 10 days.",
