        "description": "(Kaspersky) {{Dridex}} made its first appearance as an independent malicious program (under the name \u201cCridex\u201d) around September 2011. An analysis of a Cridex sample (MD5: 78cc821b5acfc017c855bc7060479f84) demonstrated that, even in its early days, the malware could receive dynamic configuration files, use web injections to steal money, and was able to infect USB media. This ability influenced the name under which the \u201czero\u201d version of Cridex was detected \u2014 Worm.Win32.Cridex.",
