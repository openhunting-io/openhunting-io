Tomiris\u2019s endgame consistently appears to be the regular theft of internal documents.\n\nThe threat actor targets government and diplomatic entities in the CIS. The occasional victims discovered in other regions (such as the Middle East or South-East Asia) turn out to be foreign representations of CIS countries, illustrating Tomiris\u2019s narrow focus.\n\nIt is characterized by its tendency to develop numerous low-sophistication \u201cburner\u201d implants in a variety of programming languages that are repeatedly deployed against the same targets, using elementary but efficient packaging and distribution techniques. Tomiris occasionally leverages commercial or open-source RATs.<nr />\nLanguage artifacts discovered in Tomiris\u2019s implant families and infrastructure from distinct campaigns all indicate that the threat actor is Russian-speaking.\n\nOverall, Tomiris is a very agile and determined actor, open to experimentation \u2013 for instance with delivery methods (DNS hijacking) or command and control (C2) channels (Telegram).\n\nKaspersky also asserts that there exists a form of deliberate cooperation between Tomiris and {{Turla, Waterbug, Venomous Bear}}.",
