        "description": "(Palo Alto) We believe that the Lotus Blossom group developed the Elise malware specifically to meet the needs of the attack campaigns, and we\u2019ve observed three variants across 50 samples during the three-year period of these attacks. Elise is a relatively sophisticated tool, including variants with the ability to evade detection in virtual environments, connect to command-and-control servers for additional instruction, and exfiltrate data.",
