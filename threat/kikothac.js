        "description": "(Group-IB) During the first operations the cybercriminals used a third-party patched backdoor Kikothac without access to its source code. They chose a Trojan, which had been known since November 2015, and did not require a lot of time for reverse engineering and back end implementation.\nThe usage of this disassembled backdoor indicates that the group started without preparation and the first operation was a mere attempt to test their capabilities.",
