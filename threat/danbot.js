        "description": "(SecureWorks) A first-stage remote access trojan (RAT) that uses DNS and HTTP-based communication mechanisms and provides basic remote access capability, including the abilities to execute arbitrary commands via cmd.exe and to upload and download files.\n\nDanBot is written in C# using .NET Framework 2.0 and provides basic remote access capabilities. The DNS channel of DanBot's C2 protocol uses both IPv4 A records and IPv6 AAAA records for communication. The HTTP channel has evolved slightly since the early 2018 samples but retains common elements throughout.",
