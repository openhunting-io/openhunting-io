        "description": "(Flashpoint) LAPSUS$ is an extortionist threat group that became active on December 10, 2921. Unlike the majority of extortionist groups that typically rely on a combination of ransomware and data leaks, LAPSUS$ is focused on monetizing their operations exclusively through data leaks advertised on Telegram without the use of ransomware.\n\nInitially, the group focused on data breaches against Latin American and Portuguese targets but in late February 2022, LAPSUS$ began widening the scope of its targeting by announcing it had successfully breached US-based graphics and computing chip manufacturer Nvidia. Since then, LAPSUS$ has continued to focus on large-scale international technology companies, including Microsoft, Okta, and Samsung, as the financial incentive for stealing source code and extorting companies for sensitive proprietary technical data is high.",
