        "description": "(Trustwave) During a recent United States Secret Service investigation, Trustwave encountered a new family of POS malware, that we named Punkey. It appears to have evolved from the {{NewPosThings}} family of malware first discovered by Dennis Schwarz and Dave Loftus at Arbor Networks. While this malware shares some commonalities with that family, it departs from the standard operating procedure of the previous versions rather dramatically. In a blog post, TrendMicro also detailed recently compiled versions of the NewPOSthings family that bear a closer resemblance to NewPOSthings than Punkey. This suggests that multiple actors may be using similar source code, or the malware is being customized as a service for targeted campaigns.",
