That assessment was based in part on Longhorn using a zero-day software exploit, which Symantec found embedded within a Microsoft Word document. The exploit delivered a data-stealing tool called Plexor.\n\n'The malware had all the hallmarks of a sophisticated cyberespionage group,' Symantec writes. 'Aside from access to zero-day exploits, the group had preconfigured Plexor with elements that indicated prior knowledge of the target environment.'",
