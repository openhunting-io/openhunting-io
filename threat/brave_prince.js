        "description": "(McAfee) Brave Prince is a Korean-language implant that contains similar code and behavior to the {{Gold Dragon}} variants, specifically the system profiling and control server communication mechanism. The malware gathers detailed logs about the victim\u2019s configuration, contents of the hard drive, registry, scheduled tasks, running processes, and more. Brave Prince was first observed in the wild December 13, 2017, sending logs to the attacker via South Korea\u2019s Daum email service. Later variants posted the data to a web server via an HTTP post command, in the same way that Gold Dragon does.",
