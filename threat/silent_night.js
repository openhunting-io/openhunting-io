        "description": "(Malwarebytes) Recently, we have been observinganother bot, with the design reminding of {{Zeus}}, that seems to be fairly new (a 1.0 version was compiled at the end of November 2019), and is actively developed. Since the specific name of this malware was for a long time unknown among researchers, it happened to be referenced by a generic term {{ZLoader}}/Zbot (a common name used to refer to any malware related to the ZeuS family).\n\nOur investigation led us to find that this is a new family built upon the ZeuS heritage, being sold under the name \u201cSilent Night\u201d. In our report, we will call it \u201cSilent Night\u201d Zbot.",
