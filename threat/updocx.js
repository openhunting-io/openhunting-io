        "description": "UpDocX was written in VB.NET and compiled without any attempts at obfuscating the source code. There is also no attempt in obfuscating C2 network traffic. It has limited functionality and appears to be a simple backdoor used solely for keylogging and uploading documents to designated C2 servers. The attackers have, however, put some effort into avoiding detection and hindering investigations. UpDocX has a list of extensive clean-up functions responsible for eliminating evidence of compromise, which indicates a degree of caution often not observed in targeted attacks.",
