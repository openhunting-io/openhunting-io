        "description": "(Check Point) The wiping procedure itself is pretty simple. First, the malware goes over the files and directories from the paths_to_wipe config, fills them with zero-bytes instead of their real content, and then deletes them.\nAfter the wiping procedure, the malware tries to delete the shadow copies by running the following commands: vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet **and **C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\wbem\\\\wmic.exe shadowcopy delete. Finally, the malware enters an infinite loop where it sleeps based on the is_alive_loop_interval value from the configuration file and writes 'Meteor is still alive.' to the log in every iteration.\nIf all this rings familiar to you, it should; it\u2019s all straight out from the ransomware playbook \u2014 except this isn\u2019t ransomware, which requires delicate orchestration of public-key and private-key cryptography to make the machine ultimately recoverable; this is Nuke-it-From-Orbit-ware. It\u2019s a one-way trip.",
