Tracking down these infections was quite a difficult task due to the multiple concealment measures taken by the attackers. The attackers select only a handful of targets to avoid unnecessary exposure. New and custom versions are developed, compiled and deployed specifically for certain targets, and \u201dradio silence\u201d periods are configured and embedded specifically into each targeted implant.",
