        "description": "(McAfee) TDrop is the third generation of HTTP {{Troy}}. TDrop uses one of two DLL files, payload32.dll and payload64.dll, and injects one, depending on operating system, into svchost.exe. Previous versions used bs.dll, which contained the code for communicating with the IRC botnet. TDrop has some further functionality not present in HTTP Troy that extends this Trojan\u2019s ability to operate on 64-bit machines and to evade automated analysis systems and emulation technologies.",
