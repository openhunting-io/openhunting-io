        "description": "(Trend Micro) Last August , security researchers released a blog discussing a new ATM malware family called Ripper which they believe was involved in the recent ATM attacks in Thailand.  Large numbers of ATMs were also temporarily shut down as a precautionary measure.\n\nThat analysis gave an overview of the techniques used by the malware, the fact that it targets three major ATM vendors, and compared Ripper to previous ATM malware families. Their analysis was based on the file with MD5 hash 15632224b7e5ca0ccb0a042daf2adc13. This file was uploaded to Virustotal by a user in Thailand on August 23.",
