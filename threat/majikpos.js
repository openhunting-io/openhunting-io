        "description": "(Trend Micro) While other PoS malware {{FastPOS}} (its updated version), {{Gorynych}} and {{ModPOS}} also feature multiple components with entirely different functions like keylogging, MajikPOS\u2019s modular tack is different. MajikPOS needs only another component from the server to conduct its RAM scraping routine.\n\nMajikPOS is named after its command and control (C&C) panel that receives commands and sends exfiltrated data. MajikPOS\u2019s operators use a combination of PoS malware and remote access Trojan (RAT) to attack their targets, to daunting effects. MajikPOS is a reflection of the increasing complexity that bad guys are predicted to employ in their malware to neuter traditional defenses.",
