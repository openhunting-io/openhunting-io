        "description": "(Sentinel Labs) The Gootkit Banking Trojan was discovered back in 2014, and utilizes the Node.JS library to perform a range of malicious tasks, from website injections and password grabbing, all the way up to video recording and remote VNC capabilities. Since its discovery in 2014, the actors behind Gootkit have continued to update the codebase to slow down analysis and thwart automated sandboxes. This post will take a look into the first stage of Gootkit, which contains the unpacking phase and a malicious downloader that sets up the infected system, and its multiple anti-analysis mechanisms.",
