        "description": "(Kaspersky) This malware is 220Kb in size. It was built as MFC framework application with a lot of extra calls that should have complicated the analysis of the sample. It mimics a GUI desktop application but it does not create any visible windows or dialogs to interact with local users. The Trojan collects data about the system and anti-malware software installed on it, and uploads that data to Darkhotel command and control servers.",
