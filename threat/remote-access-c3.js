        "description": "(Trend Micro) The remote-access-c3 backdoor seems to be inspired by Patchwork\u2019s {{NDiskMonitor}} because they share some behaviors, strings, and commands. remote-access-c3 is written in C++ using the Standard Template Library (STL) library. When remote-backdoor-c3 is executed, it waits for a certain time, because of its long initial time delay. It later loads and executes all modules saved in the system registry, establishes persistence via Task Scheduler, and starts a beaconing thread.",
