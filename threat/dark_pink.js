To date, Group-IB\u2019s Threat Intelligence has been able to attribute seven successful attacks to this particular group from June-December 2022, with targets including military bodies, government ministries and agencies, and religious and non-profit organizations, although the list of victims could be significantly longer. Group-IB also noted one unsuccessful attack on a European state development body based in Vietnam.",
