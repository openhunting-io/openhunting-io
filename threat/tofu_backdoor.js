        "description": "(Cylance) Based upon Cylance\u2019s observations, the Tofu Backdoor was deployed in far fewer instances than the Ham Backdoor. It is a proxy-aware, fully-featured backdoor programmed in C++ and compiled using Visual Studio 2015. The Tofu backdoor makes extensive use of threading to perform individual tasks within the code. It communicates with its C2 server through HTTP over nonstandard TCP ports, and will send encoded information containing basic system information back, including hostname, username, and operating system within the content of the POST.",
