        "description": "(Trend Micro) Cutlet Maker is an ATM malware designed to empty the machine of all its banknotes. Interestingly, while its authors have been advertising its sale, their competitors have already cracked the program, allowing anybody to use it for free.\n\nEvery time the program runs, it creates and displays a code. The user then needs to contact the developers and provide this code. After receiving payment, the developers provide the license code that unlocks the program\u2019s jackpotting feature. No payment, no jackpotting. This happens every time the criminals try to use Cutlet Maker against a different ATM.",
