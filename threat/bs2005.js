        "description": "(FireEye) Over the years, the Ke3chang attackers have used three types of malware that we call: \u201cBS2005\u201d, \u201cBMW\u201d, and \u201cMyWeb\u201d. We believe these three types of malware are an evolution of a single project from a single developer or small team of developers sharing code. Functionally, it is a typical first stage backdoor commonly found in APT attacks. It has the ability to upload and download files, run shell commands, and sleep for a configurable length of time. All of the CnC communications are performed over the HTTP protocol.",
