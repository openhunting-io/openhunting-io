The attackers lure the victims into installing the VolatileVenom under the pretext that the suggested app is more \u201csecure\u201d and \u201cdiscrete.\u201d Based on our investigation, it seems that VolatileVenom has been operationalized and integrated into the group's arsenal since at least April of 2020, and disguises itself using icons and names of chat applications.",
