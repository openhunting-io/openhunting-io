        "description": "(Citizen Lab) Israel-based \u201cCyber Warfare\u201d vendor NSO Group produces and sells a mobile phone spyware suite called Pegasus. To monitor a target, a government operator of Pegasus must convince the target to click on a specially crafted exploit link, which, when clicked, delivers a chain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone and installs Pegasus without the user\u2019s knowledge or permission. Once the phone is exploited and Pegasus is installed, it begins contacting the operator\u2019s command and control (C&C) servers to receive and execute operators\u2019 commands, and send back the target\u2019s private data, including passwords, contact lists, calendar events, text messages, and live voice calls from popular mobile messaging apps. The operator can even turn on the phone\u2019s camera and microphone to capture activity in the phone\u2019s vicinity.",
