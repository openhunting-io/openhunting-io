As we have seen several times since the {{Zeus}} source code became available, new malware variants based on this codebase continue to emerge. Floki Bot is unique in that the authors of this malware have put effort into expanding upon the functionality that was present in Zeus and have implemented new functionality making Floki Bot very attractive to criminals.",
