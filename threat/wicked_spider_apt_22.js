        "description": "(CrowdStrike) {{Winnti Group, Blackfly, Wicked Panda}} refers to the targeted intrusion operations of the actor publicly known as \u201cWinnti,\u201d whereas Wicked Spider represents this group\u2019s financially-motivated criminal activity. Originally, Wicked Spider was observed exploiting a number of gaming companies and stealing code-signing certificates for use in other operations associated with the malware known as Winnti. Now, Winnti is commonly associated with the interests of the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\n\nWicked Spider has been observed targeting technology companies in Germany, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, South Korea, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, the United States, and elsewhere. Notably, Wicked Spider has often targeted gaming companies for their certificates, which can be used in future PRC-based operations to sign malware. Ongoing analysis is still evaluating how these certificates are used \u2014 whether Wicked Spider hands the certificates off to other adversaries for use in future campaigns or stockpiles them for its own use.",
