        "description": "(Symantec) Raindrop (Backdoor.Raindrop) is a loader which delivers a payload of {{Cobalt Strike}}. Raindrop is very similar to the already documented {{TEARDROP}} tool, but there are some key differences between the two. While Teardrop was delivered by the initial {{SUNBURST}} backdoor (Backdoor.Sunburst), Raindrop appears to have been used for spreading across the victim\u2019s network. Symantec has seen no evidence to date of Raindrop being delivered directly by Sunburst. Instead, it appears elsewhere on networks where at least one computer has already been compromised by Sunburst.",
