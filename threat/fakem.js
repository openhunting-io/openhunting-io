        "description": "(Trend Micro) We found a family of RATs that we call \u201cFAKEM\u201d that make their network traffic look like various protocols. Some variants attempt to disguise network traffic to look like Windows\u00ae Messenger and Yahoo!\u00ae Messenger traffic. Another variant tries to make the content of its traffic look like HTML. While the disguises the RATs use are simple and distinguishable from legitimate traffic, they may be just good enough to avoid further scrutiny.",
