Machines infected by Vawtrak form part of a botnet that collectively harvests login credentials for the online accounts to a wide variety of financial and other industry organisations. These stolen credentials are used, in combination with injected code and by proxying through the victim\u2019s machine, to initiate fraudulent transfers to bank accounts controlled by the Vawtrak botnet administrators.",
