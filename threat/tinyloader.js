        "description": "(Fidelis) Tinyloader has a few unique characteristics\n\n\u2022 It is, in fact, tiny \u2014 typically weighing in under 5 KB.\n\u2022 Its command-and-control (C2) server runs on Microsoft Windows, which is fairly uncommon in malware today.\n\u2022 Finally, it is extremely versatile due to its modular C2 mechanism. This mechanism allows the C2 server to pass custom bytecode directly into the running memory of the bot making it easy to load new malware or augment additional malicious behaviors.",
