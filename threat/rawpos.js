        "description": "(Trend Micro) Despite being one of the oldest Point-of-Sale (PoS) RAM scraper malware families out in the wild, RawPOS (detected by Trend Micro as TSPY_RAWPOS) is still very active today, with the threat actors behind it primarily focusing on the lucrative multibillion-dollar hospitality industry. While the threat actor\u2019s tools for lateral movement, as well as RawPOS\u2019 components, remain consistent, new behavior from the malware puts its victims at greater risk via potential identity theft. Specifically, this new behavior involves RawPOS stealing the driver\u2019s license information from the user to aid in the threat group\u2019s malicious activities.",
