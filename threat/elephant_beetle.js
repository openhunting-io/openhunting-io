        "description": "(Sygnia) For the past two years, Sygnia\u2019s Incident Response (IR) team has been tracking a financially motivated threat group targeting and infiltrating organizations from the finance and commerce sector in Latin America.\nThe attack is relentless in its ingenious simplicity serving as an ideal tactic to hide in plain sight, without any need to develop exploits.\nUsing an arsenal of over 80 unique tools & scripts, the group executes its attacks patiently over long periods of time, blending in with the target\u2019s environment and going completely undetected while it quietly liberates organizations of exorbitant amounts of money. We are dubbing this group \u2013 Elephant Beetle.\nElephant Beetle seems to primarily focus on the Latin American market, but that doesn\u2019t mean that organizations that are not based there are safe. Sygnia\u2019s IR team discovered and responded to an incident at a U.S. based company with an operations branch in Latin America. As such, both regional and global organizations should be on their guard.\nThe group is highly proficient with Java based attacks and, in many cases, target legacy Java applications running on Linux-based machines as the means for initial entry to the network. Not only that, the group even deploys their own complete Java Web Application on the victim machine to do their bidding while the machine also runs the intentional application.\nThis report is a technical play-by-play of the Elephant Beetle attack as detected, observed and mitigated by Sygnia\u2019s IR team. Elephant Beetle resembles the group tracked by Mandiant as {{FIN13}}.",
