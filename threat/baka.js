        "description": "(Visa) In February 2020, Visa Payment Fraud Disruption (PFD), using the eCommerce Threat Disruption (eTD) capability, identified a previously unknown ecommerce skimmer, and named the skimmer \u2018Baka\u2019. PFD made the discovery while analyzing a command and control (C2) server that was previously observed hosting the ImageID skimmer variant. PFD\u2019s investigation revealed seven C2 servers hosting the Baka skimming kit. While the skimmer itself is basicand contains the expected features offered by many ecommerce skimming kits (e.g. data exfiltration using image requests and configurable target form fields), the Bakaskimming kit\u2019s advanced design indicates it was created by a skilled developer.",
