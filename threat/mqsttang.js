        "description": "(ESET) MQsTTang is a barebones backdoor that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a victim\u2019s machine and get the output. Even so, it does present some interesting characteristics. Chief among these is its use of the MQTT protocol for C&C communication. MQTT is typically used for communication between IoT devices and controllers, and the protocol hasn\u2019t been used in many publicly documented malware families.",
