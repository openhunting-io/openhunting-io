        "description": "(Citizen Lab) We observed POISON CARP employing a total of eight Android browser exploits and one Android spyware kit, as well as one iOS exploit chain and iOS spyware. None of the exploits that we observed were zero days. POISON CARP overlaps with two recently reported campaigns against the Uyghur community. The iOS exploit and spyware we observed was used in watering hole attacks reported by Google Project Zero, and a website used to serve exploits by POISON CARP was also observed in a campaign called \u201cEvil Eye\u201d reported by Volexity. The Android malware used in the campaign is a fully featured spyware kit that has not been previously documented.",
