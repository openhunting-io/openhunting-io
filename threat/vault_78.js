        "description": "An unnamed source leaked almost 10,000 documents describing a large number of 0-day vulnerabilities, methodologies and tools that had been collected by the {{CIA}}'s {{Subgroup: Longhorn, The Lamberts}}. This leaking was done through WikiLeaks, since March 2017. In weekly publications, the dumps were said to come from Vault 7 and later Vault 8, until his arrest in 2018.\n\nMost of the published vulnerabilities have since been fixed by the respective vendors, but many have been used by other threat actors.\n\nThis actor turned out to be a former CIA software engineer.\n\n(WikiLeaks) Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named \u201cVault 7\u201d by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.\n\nThe first full part of the series, \u201cYear Zero\u201d, comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA\u2019s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.\n\nRecently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, Trojans, weaponized \u201czero day\u201d exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\n\n\u201cYear Zero\u201d introduces the scope and direction of the CIA\u2019s global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of \u201czero day\u201d weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple\u2019s iPhone, Google\u2019s Android and Microsoft\u2019s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.",
