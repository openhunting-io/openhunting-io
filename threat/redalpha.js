        "description": "(Recorded Future) The RedAlpha campaigns began in mid-2017 by targeting the Tibetan community in India. The latest campaign remains ongoing, with new subdomains registered in late April 2018. The threat actor utilized a careful combination of victim reconnaissance and fingerprinting, followed by selective targeting with multi-stage malware. The malware utilized changed from a reliable custom toolset in the 2017 campaign to a more cautious and spartan approach, ending with commodity malware in 2018. Observing these two campaigns in succession demonstrates the evolution of a relatively unknown threat actor.",
