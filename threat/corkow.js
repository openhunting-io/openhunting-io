        "description": "(ESET) The malware, which has been in the wild since at least 2011, has demonstrated continuous activity in the past year, infecting thousands of users. Version numbering of the various Trojan modules is another indicator that the malware authors are continually developing the trojan.\n\nThe most common infection vector \u2013 drive-by downloads \u2013 has been used to spread the malware.\n\nThis Russian tool for committing bank fraud shares many characteristics with other malware families with a similar purpose, such as {{Zeus}} (also known as Zbot), {{JHUHUGIT}}, {{HesperBot}}, or Qadars, for example, but also contains some unique functionality.\n\nSeveral features, like enumeration of smart cards, targeting of dedicated banking applications mostly used by corporate customers and looking for user activity regarding online banking sites and applications, electronic trading platform sites and applications and so forth, all suggest that the attackers are focusing their sights on financial professionals and enterprises, whose bank accounts usually hold a higher balance than those of most individuals.",
