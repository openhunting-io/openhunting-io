While some individual sightings of this attack were previously reported by other researchers and journalists, our investigation allowed us to connect the different campaigns and attribute them to the same attackers.\n\nAmong the different attack vectors we found were:\n\u2022 Four variants of Windows infostealers intended to steal the victim\u2019s personal documents as well as access to their Telegram Desktop and KeePass account information\n\u2022 Android backdoor that extracts two-factor authentication codes from SMS messages, records the phone\u2019s voice surroundings and more\n\u2022 Telegram phishing pages, distributed using fake Telegram service accounts\n\nThe above tools and methods appear to be mainly used against Iranian minorities, anti-regime organizations and resistance movements such as:\n\u2022 Association of Families of Camp Ashraf and Liberty Residents (AFALR)\n\u2022 Azerbaijan National Resistance Organization\n\u2022 Balochistan people",
