It was a targeted campaign which appeared to focus on individuals and organizations in Pakistan, specifically the government and the military. Cylance\u2019s window into this campaign, though significant, is not all-encompassing. Indeed, our research revealed evidence that The White Company conducted extensive prior reconnaissance of its targets, and continues to operate largely unnoticed by the security community.",
