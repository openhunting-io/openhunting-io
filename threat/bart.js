        "description": "(Proofpoint) Bart ransomware appeared for exactly one day on June 24, 2016. It was a secondary payload downloaded by {{RockLoader}}, the initial payload in a large email campaign using zipped JavaScript attachments. The Bart ransom screen was visually similar to {{Locky}}\u2019s but Bart had one important distinction: it could encrypt files without contacting a command and control server. However, we have not seen Bart since, suggesting that this was either an experiment or that the ransomware did not function as expected for TA505.",
