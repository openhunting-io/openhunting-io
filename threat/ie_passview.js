It supports all versions of Internet Explorer, from version 4.0 and up to 11.0, as well as Microsoft Edge Browser.\nFor each password that is stored by Internet Explorer, the following information is displayed: Web address, Password Type (AutoComplete, Password-Protected Web Site, or FTP), Storage Location (Registry, Credentials File, or Protected Storage), and the user name/password pair. You can select one or more items from the passwords list and export them into text/html/csv/xml file.\nIE PassView also allows you to extract the passwords of Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge from external hard drive.",
