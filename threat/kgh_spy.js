        "description": "(Cybereason) During our analysis, Cybereason Nocturnus discovered a new malware suite dubbed \u201cKGH\u201d which contains several modules used as spyware. The name \u201cKGH\u201d is derived from the PDB path and internal names found in the malware samples.\nA possible link to North Korean attacks referencing the name \u201cKGH\u201d was mentioned in 2017 in a research by Ahnlab, however it is unclear whether it is related to the same malware authors.",
