        "description": "(ThreatFabric) This campaign involves a highly flexible novel Android malware dubbed BrasDex by ThreatFabric, featuring a complex keylogging system designed to abuse Accessibility Services to extract credentials specifically from a set of Brazilian targeted apps, as well as a highly capable Automated Transfer System (ATS) engine.\n\nWhen analyzing BrasDex, our team found the evidence of some desktop malware controlled through the same backend. Our analysts were able to identify the malware samples related to the same campaign targeting Brazilian users as well: it involves Casbaneiro, a well-known malware family known to be active in Latin America.",
