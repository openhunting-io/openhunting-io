        "description": "(Novetta) Functionally, RomeoHotel is nearly identical to {{RomeoAlfa}}: RomeoHotel supports the same commands within the R-C1 portion of itself, has an identical configuration data structure in both size and field meaning to that of RomeoAlfa-Two, and uses fake TLS for communication. RomeoHotel supports the same command set found in RomeoAlfa-Two, but supports all commands fully, while RomeoAlfa-Two does not fully support all of its commands. For example, RomeoHotel supports the RunAs command fully while the RomeoAlfa variants will accept the command but will perform not action as a result of the instruction from the C2 server.",
