Victims may have had their sensitive personal information stolen (e.g., user account credentials). Victims\u2019 compromised systems may also have been used to conduct other malicious activity, such as launching denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or distributing malware variants to other victims\u2019 computers.\n\nIn addition, Avalanche infrastructure was used to run money mule schemes where criminals recruited people to commit fraud involving transporting and laundering stolen money or merchandise.\n\nAvalanche used fast-flux DNS, a technique to hide the criminal servers, behind a constantly changing network of compromised systems acting as proxies.\n\nAvalanche has been observed to distribute GozNym (operated by Bamboo Spider, TA544|used-by}} and much of the malware from {{TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen}}.",
