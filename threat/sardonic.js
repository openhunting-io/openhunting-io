        "description": "(Bitdefender) As this backdoor has not been documented or referenced before, we named it \u201cSardonic\u201d, given that artifacts led us to believe the threat actors use this name for an entire project including the backdoor itself, the loader and some additional scripts. We believe this project is still under development, and additional updates will likely follow.\n\nKey facts about Sardonic:\n\u2022 Sardonic is a new backdoor in the FIN8 ecosystem\n\u2022 Sardonic is a project still under development and includes several components\n\u2022 The new components were identified in a real-life attack and seems to be compiled just before the attack\n\u2022 Sardonic backdoor is extremely potent and has a wide range of capabilities that help the threat actor leverage new malware on the fly without updating components",
