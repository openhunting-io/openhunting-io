        "description": "(QuoINT) We have observed a Windows Shortcut file dubbed as VenomLNK used in various campaigns involving different infection chains. We hypothesize this is a new variation of a previously highlighted malicious document kit builder known as {{VenomKit}}, a building-kit tool that threat actors use to craft malicious Rich Text File (RTF) documents that exploit multiple vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation of those vulnerabilities leads to the delivery of batch and scriptlet files on a system and execution to download the second stage payload from a Web resource.",
