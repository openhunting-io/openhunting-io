We attribute this activity to a threat activity group tracked as RedGolf, which is highly likely to be a Chinese state-sponsored group.\n\nRedGolf closely overlaps with threat activity reported in open sources under the aliases {{APT 41}}/{{Barium}} and has likely carried out state-sponsored espionage activity in parallel with financially motivated operations for personal gain from at least 2014 onward. A 2020 US Department of Justice indictment states that a RedGolf-associated threat actor boasted of connections to the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS); the indicted actors were also linked to the Chengdu-based company Chengdu 404 Network Technology (\u6210\u90fd\u5e02\u8086\u96f6\u8086\u7f51\u7edc\u79d1\u6280\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8).",
