        "description": "A subgroup of the {{CIA}}.\n\n(ClearSky) Over the last few weeks, several significant leaks regarding a number of Iranian APTs took place. After analyzing and investigating the documents we conclude that they are authentic. Consequently, this causes considerable harm to the groups and their operation. The identity of the actor behind the leak is currently unknown, however based on the scope and the quality of the exposed documents and information, it appears that they are professional and highly capable. This leak will likely hamstring the groups\u2019 operation in the near future. Accordingly, in our assessment this will minimize the risk of potential attacks in the next few months and possibly even year. Note \u2013most of the leaks are posted on Telegram channels that were created specifically for this purpose.\n\nBelow are the three main Telegram groups on which the leaks were posted:\n\u2022 Lab Dookhtegam pseudonym (\u201cThe people whose lips are stitched and sealed\u201d \u2013translation from Persian) \u2013In this channel attack tools attributed to the group \u2018{{OilRig, APT 34, Helix Kitten, Chrysene}}\u2019 were leaked; including a webshell that was inserted into the Technion, various tools that were used for DNS attacks, and more.\n\u2022 Green Leakers\u2013In this channel attack tools attributed to the group \u2018{{MuddyWater, Seedworm, TEMP.Zagros, Static Kitten}}\u2019 were leaked. The group\u2019s name and its symbol are identified with the \u201cgreen movement\u201d, which led the protests in Iran after the Presidential elections in 2009. These protests were heavily repressed by the revolutionary guards (IRGC)\n\u2022 Black Box\u2013Unlike the previous two channels this has been around for a long time. On Friday May 5th, dozens of confidential documents labeled as \u201csecret\u201d (a high confidentiality level in Iran, one before the highest \u2013top secret) were posted on this channel. The documents were related to Iranian attack groups\u2019 activity. See {{[Unnamed group Iran]}}.",
