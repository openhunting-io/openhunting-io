        "description": "(Recorded Future) Scanbox is a reconnaissance framework that enables attackers to track visitors to compromised websites, performs keylogging, and harvests data that could be used to enable follow-on compromises. It has also been reported to have been modified in order to deliver secondary malware on targeted hosts. Written in Javascript and PHP, Scanbox deployment negates the need for malware to be downloaded onto the host device.",
