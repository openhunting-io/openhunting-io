        "description": "(ESET) XDDown is nothing but a downloader \u2013 hence our chosen name. This architecture choice is quite different from what we see in other APT malware frameworks, which tend to be quite complex with a whole set of backdoor commands and a logging mechanism. On one hand, the XDSpy approach is easier to develop but, on the other hand, it is much less flexible for the operators as a new binary needs to be built, downloaded and executed to perform any action on the compromised machine.",
