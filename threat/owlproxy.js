        "description": "(ESET) Across the victims and malware we analyzed here, an interesting piece of malware stood out and needed a deeper look. From an initial, quick analysis, it was recognized as OwlProxy; an HTTP proxy server. A complete analysis can be found in this Cycraft post. This module also comes in two variants \u2013 32- and 64-bit versions \u2013 and as a result it contains a function to test the Windows version as in the {{Gelsemium}} components.",
