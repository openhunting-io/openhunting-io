Code similarities with Gelsemium components are almost nonexistent but small indicators were found during the analysis that leads us to believe that it\u2019s somehow related to the group. The same C&C server was found in both {{Gelsevirine}} and Chrommme, both are using two C&C servers. Chrommme was found on an organization\u2019s machine also compromised by Gelsemium group.",
