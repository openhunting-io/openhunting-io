        "description": "(Kaspersky) The first version of ZeuS-in-the-Mobile (ZitMo), malware which targets mTANs, was discovered in the end of September 2010. In that case it was targeting Symbian smartphones. Later on, ZitMo versions for Windows Mobile and Blackberry were found. It comes as no surprise that cybercriminals have created new and sophisticated pieces of mobile malware for Symbian and Windows Mobile; more surprising is that Blackberry devices were also targeted; and even more surprising is that until July 2011 there was no evidence of ZitMo for Android\u2019s existence. And now please \u2018welcome\u2019 ZeuS-in-the-Mobile for Android.\n\nThe first fact that must be mentioned is that ZitMo for Android differs from Symbian, Windows Mobile and Blackberry versions a lot. The functionality and logic of ZitMo for Symbian, Windows Mobile and Blackberry is the same: C&C cell phone number, SMS commands, and the ability to forward SMS messages from a particular number, as well as the ability to change C&C.\n\nThe functionality and logic of ZitMo for Android is far more primitive. The APK file itself has a 19k size. It passes itself off as a security tool from the \u2018Trusteer\u2019 company.",
