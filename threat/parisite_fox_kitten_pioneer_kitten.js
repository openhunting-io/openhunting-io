Though the campaign, the attackers succeeded in gaining access and persistent foothold in the networks of numerous companies and organizations from the IT,Telecommunication,Oil and Gas, Aviation, Government, and Security sectors around the world.\n\nDuring our analysis, we have found an overlap, with medium-high probability, between this campaign\u2019s infrastructure and the activity of an Iranian offensive group {{OilRig, APT 34, Helix Kitten, Chrysene}}. Additionally, we have identified, with medium probability, a connection between this campaign and the {{APT 33, Elfin, Magnallium}} and {{Chafer, APT 39}} groups.The campaign was first revealed by Dragos, named \u201cParisite\u201dand attributed to APT33; we call the comprehensive campaign revealed in this report \u201cFox Kitten\u201d.\n\nThe initial breach of the targeted organizations was performed, in most cases, by exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in different VPN services such as: Pulse Secure VPN, Fortinet VPN, and Global Protect by Palo Alto Networks. Upon gaining foothold at the target, the attackers tried to maintain the access to the networks by opening a variety of communication tools, including opening RDP links over SSH tunneling, in order to camouflage and encrypt the communication with the targets. At the final stage, after successfully infiltrating the organization, the attackers have performed a routine process of identification, examination, and filtering of sensitive, valuable information from every targeted organization.The valuable information was sent back to the attackers for reconnaissance, espionage, or further infection of connected networks.",
