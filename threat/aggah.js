In this campaign we have seen several PowerPoint presentations, some with Covid-19 related names, and others are invoices. The presentations are usually empty of content, besides a short and simple VBA macro that uses a StrReverse function to evade basic detection by AV products. Once opened it downloads the next stage of the malware via the \u201cShell\u201d command.",
