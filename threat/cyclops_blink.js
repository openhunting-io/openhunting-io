        "description": "(CISA) The NCSC, CISA, the FBI, and NSA, along with industry partners, have now identified a large-scale modular malware framework (T1129) which is targeting network devices. The new malware is referred to here as Cyclops Blink and has been deployed since at least June 2019, fourteen months after VPNFilter was disrupted. In common with VPNFilter, Cyclops Blink deployment also appears indiscriminate and widespread.\n\nThe actor has so far primarily deployed Cyclops Blink to WatchGuard devices, but it is likely that Sandworm would be capable of compiling the malware for other architectures and firmware.",
