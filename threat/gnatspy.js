        "description": "(Trend Micro) The capabilities of GnatSpy are similar to early versions of {{VAMP}}. However, there have been some changes in its behavior that highlight the increasing sophistication of this particular threat actor.\n\nThe structure of the new GnatSpy variants is very different from previous variants. More receivers and services have been added, making this malware more capable and modular. We believe this indicates that GnatSpy was designed by someone with more knowledge in good software design practices compared to previous authors.",
