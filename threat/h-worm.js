We believe the author is based in Algeria and has connections to njq8, the author of njw0rm and {{njRAT}}/LV through means of a shared or common code base. We have seen the H-worm RAT being employed in targeted attacks against the international energy industry; however, we also see it being employed in a wider context as run of the mill attacks through spammed email attachments and malicious links.",
