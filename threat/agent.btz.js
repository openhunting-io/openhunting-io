        "description": "(Kaspersky) The story of Agent.btz began back in 2007 and was extensively covered by the mass media in late 2008 when it was used to infect US military networks.\n\nHere is what Wikipedia has to say about it: \u201cThe 2008 cyberattack on the United States was the \u2018worst breach of U.S. military computers in history\u2019. The defense against the attack was named \u2018Operation Buckshot Yankee\u2019. It led to the creation of the United States Cyber Command.\n\nIt started when a USB flash drive infected by a foreign intelligence agency was left in the parking lot of a Department of Defense facility at a base in the Middle East. It contained malicious code and was put into a USB port from a laptop computer that was attached to United States Central Command.",
