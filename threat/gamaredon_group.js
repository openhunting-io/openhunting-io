        "description": "(Lookingglass) The Lookingglass Cyber Threat Intelligence Group (CTIG) has been tracking an ongoing cyber espionage campaign named \u201cOperation Armageddon\u201d. The name was derived from multiple Microsoft Word documents used in the attacks. \u201cArmagedon\u201d (spelled incorrectly) was found in the \u201cLast Saved By\u201d and \u201cAuthor\u201d fields in multiple Microsoft Word documents. Although continuously developed, the campaign has been intermittently active at a small scale, and uses unsophisticated techniques. The attack timing suggests the campaign initially started due to Ukraine\u2019s decision to accept the Ukraine-\u00ad\u2010European Union Association Agreement (AA). The agreement was designed to improve economic integrations between Ukraine and the European Union. Russian leaders publicly stated that they believed this move by Ukraine directly threatened Russia\u2019s national security. Although initial steps to join the Association occurred in March 2012, the campaign didn\u2019t start until much later (mid\u20102013), as Ukraine and the EU started to more actively move towards the agreement.\n\nRussian actors began preparing for attacks in case Ukraine finalized the AA. The earliest identified modification timestamp of malware used in this campaign is June 26, 2013. A group of files with modification timestamps between August 12 and September 16, 2013 were used in the first wave of spear-phishing attacks, targeting government officials prior to the 10th Yalta Annual Meeting: \u201cChanging Ukraine in a Changing World: Factors of Success.\u201d",
