There are indications of activity as early as 2014, but Cymmetria has not observed any such activity first hand.\n\nPatchwork targets were chosen worldwide with a focus on personnel working on military and political assignments, and specifically those working on issues relating to Southeast Asia and the South China Sea. Many of the targets were governments and government-related organizations.\n\nThe code used by this threat actor is copy-pasted from various online forums, in a way that reminds us of a patchwork quilt \u2013hence the name we\u2019ve given the operation.\n\nIn active victim systems, Patchwork immediately searches for and uploads documents to their C&C, and only if the target is deemed valuable enough, proceeds to install a more advanced second stage malware.\n\nThis group seems to be associated with {{Confucius}}.",
