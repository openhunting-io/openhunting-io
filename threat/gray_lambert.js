        "description": "(Kaspersky) Gray Lambert is the most recent tool in the Lamberts\u2019 arsenal. It is a network-driven backdoor, similar in functionality to {{White Lambert}}. Unlike White Lambert, which runs in kernel mode, Gray Lambert is a user-mode implant. The compilation and coding style of Gray Lambert is similar to the {{Pink Lambert}} USB stealers. Gray Lambert initially appeared on the computers of victims infected by White Lambert, which could suggest the authors were upgrading White Lambert infections to Gray. This migration activity was last observed in October 2016.\n\nSome of the known filenames for Gray Lambert are mwapi32.dll and poolstr.dll \u2013 it should be pointed though that the filenames used by the Lamberts are generally unique and have never been used twice.",
