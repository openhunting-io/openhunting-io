While it seems, for the most part, that this adversary doesn\u2019t single out particular nations and industries, there do appear to be a few pockets where SALTY SPIDER may be more prevalent.\n\nIn 2017, SALTY SPIDER ceased propagation of traditional proxy and spambot payloads, and shifted its sights towards the mining and theft of cryptocurrencies. This shift is likely an indicator that the cryptocurrency industry has proven to be a more lucrative area for monetizing Sality.",
