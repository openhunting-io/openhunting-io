These include accounts for HBO shows, such as \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d \u201cGirls,\u201d and \u201cBallers.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time that OurMine has claimed responsibility for hacking high-profile social networking accounts. Last year, the group victimized Marvel, The New York Times, and even the heads of some of the biggest technology companies in the world. Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Sundar Pichai, and Daniel Ek \u2014 the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, Google and Spotify, respectively \u2014  have also fallen victim to the hackers, dispelling the notion that a career in software and technology exempts one from being compromised.",
