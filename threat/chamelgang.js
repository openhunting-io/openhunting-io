        "description": "(Positive Technologies) In Q2 2021, the PT Expert Security Center incident response team conducted an investigation in an energy company. The investigation revealed that the company's network had been compromised by an unknown group for the purpose of data theft. We gave the group the name ChamelGang (from the word 'chameleon'), because the group disguised its malware and network infrastructure under legitimate services of Microsoft, TrendMicro, McAfee, IBM, and Google. The attackers employed two methods. They acquired domains that imitate legitimate ones. In addition, the APT group placed SSL certificates that also imitated legitimate ones on its servers. To achieve their goal, the attackers used a trending penetration method\u2014supply chain. The group compromised a subsidiary and penetrated the target company's network through it.",
