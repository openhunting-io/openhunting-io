        "description": "(NTT) Flagpro is used in the initial stage of attacks to investigate target\u2019s environment, download a second stage malware and execute it. An attack case using Flagpro starts with a spear phishing e-mail. The message is adjusted to its target organization. It is disguised as an e-mail communication with target\u2019s business partner. This means the attackers probed deeper into their target before attacking.",
