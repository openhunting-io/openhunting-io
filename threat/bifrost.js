        "description": "(Talos) Bifrost is a backdoor with more than 10 variants. Bifrost uses the typical server, server builder, and client backdoor program configuration to allow a remote attacker, who uses the client, to execute arbitrary code on the compromised machine. Bifrost contains standard RAT features including a file manager, screen capture utility, keylogging, video recording, microphone and camera monitoring, and a process manager. In order to mark its presence in the system, Bifrost uses a mutex that may be named 'Bif1234,' or 'Tr0gBot.'",
