The name Havij means \u201ccarrot\u201d, which is the tool\u2019s icon.\n\nThe tool is designed with a user-friendly GUI that makes it easy for an operator to retrieve the desired data. Such ease of use may be the reason behind the transition from attacks deployed by code-writing hackers to those by non-technical users.",
