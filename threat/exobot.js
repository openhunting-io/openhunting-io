        "description": "(IMB) ExoBot is Android malware that was based originally on a previous code known as {{Marcher}}. This code represents a banking Trojan that uses the overlay technique \u2014 that is, popping up fake windows that hide the original app users open \u2014 to trick victims into tapping their banking credentials into a fake interface. After stealing account access details, the malware can also intercept SMS messages and phone calls, thereby enabling criminals to take over the victim\u2019s bank account and other financial accounts at their discretion.\n\nSome of the capabilities that enable ExoBot to facilitate fraudulent activity on infected devices include gaining admin privileges, launching overlay screens, and exfiltrating SMS, data and other information from the infected device.",
