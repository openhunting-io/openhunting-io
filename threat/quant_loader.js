        "description": "(Barracuda) Based on past attacks, Quant Loader is a trojan that typically distributes malware such as ransomware and password stealers. It is sold on underground forums and allows the user to configure the payload(s) upon infection using a management panel. Configurable malware offered for sale such as this is becoming more widespread, which allows malware development to be separated from distribution.",
