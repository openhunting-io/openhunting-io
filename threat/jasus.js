        "description": "(Cylance) Jasus is an ARP cache poisoner developed by the Operation Cleaver team. It makes use of WinPcap and is developed in C. Compared to some other publicly available ARP cache poisoning utilities, Jasus is poorly developed and without many useful features. The primary positive attribute of Jasus is its poor detection ratio by the antivirus industry.",
