        "description": "(Carbon Black) The Pylot (or Travle) malware family appears to be an evolution of the {{NetTraveler}} malware family (which has been linked to attackers out of China by numerous sources).  Over the last year a variant has been observed as a secondary payload often used in conjunction with malicious carrier files (typically MS Office or Rich Text Format (RTF) documents).\n\nThe Pylot malware has been observed being installed via shellcode from known CVEs in Office products as well as by malware loaders (or first stage malware variants, specifically the CMStar malware family).  In late 2017 samples of the Pylot family were submitted, by customers, to the Carbon Black Threat Analysis Unit (TAU) as part of ongoing investigation.",
