        "description": "(Novetta) A self-install service-based executable, SierraAlfa begins a chain of infection that ultimately leads to the potential devastation of an entire network of computers. SierraAlfa is responsible for the distribution and activation of WhiskeyAlfa on a victim\u2019s network. The observed samples of SierraAlfa were clearly built specifically for the SPE attacks as they contain infrastructure and account information specific to SPE\u2019s networks.\n\nTwo variants have been observed: SierraAlfa-One and SierraAlfa-Two. SierraAlfa-One is the base model, while SierraAlfa-Two provides additional features to ensure the propagation of the malicious payload within.",
