The operators were mainly doing reconnaissance, lateral movement and espionage.\nThe main malicious activity is the staging, compression and exfiltration of documents and various files, as shown in Figure 1. These are commands manually executed by the operators, thus not showing the automated collection of documents by the drive monitor component described in a later section.",
