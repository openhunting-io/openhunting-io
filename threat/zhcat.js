        "description": "(Cylance) zhCat is a tool developed by the Operation Cleaver team which operates similarly to NetCat. Its main purpose is to create a channel that is capable of transporting information over the network. The changes made in zhCat allow for this information to be transferred with inline obfuscation and/or encryption. This makes it more difficult to detect that privileged information is being exfiltrated.",
