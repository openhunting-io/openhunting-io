        "description": "(Trend Micro) These attacks targeting users in the United States used a variant of {{IXESHE}} which has been seen in Taiwan since 2009 named IHEATE. These showed some differences from known IXESHE variants: they had a different command-and-control (C&C) communication model and encryption methods.\n\nOne IHEATE sample we found contains the string \u201cEMC112\u201d as part of the C&C traffic. Such strings are frequently used to identify different campaigns. In this particular case, the 112 part of the string matched the malware sample\u2019s compilation date of January 12.",
