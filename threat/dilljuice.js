        "description": "(Cylance) {{QuasarRAT}} is a lightweight remote administration tool written in C#. It can collect system information, download and execute applications, upload files, log keystrokes, grab screenshots/camera captures, retrieve system passwords and run shell commands. The remote access Trojan (RAT) is loaded by a bespoke loader (a.k.a. {{DILLWEED}}). The encrypted QuasarRAT payload is stored in the Microsoft.NET directory, decrypted into memory, and instantiated using a CLR host application. In later variants an additional component is also used to install the RAT as a service (a.k.a DILLJUICE).\n\nThe following technical analysis focuses on the bespoke QuasarRAT loader developed by MenuPass and modifications made to the QuasarRAT backdoor.",
