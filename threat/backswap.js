        "description": "(CERT.PL) Backswap is a banker, which we first observed around March 2018. It\u2019s a variant of old, well-known malware {{Tinba}} (which stands for \u201ctiny banker\u201d). As the name suggests, it\u2019s main characteristic is small size (very often in the 10-50kB range).\n\nBackswap carries out multiple harmful activities. Big ones are: injecting Webinjects and stealing credentials. Supported browsers involve Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome. Some variants also swap the contents of the clipboard when bank/cryptocurrency account number is found.",
