        "description": "(FireEye) We noticed the decoded VBScript backdoors from recent activity were nearly identical (with some small changes) to the first NINEBLOG variants we observed in 2013. The minimal code changes may be due to the fact that the encoding provides enough obfuscation to prevent detection, allowing the core functionality of the backdoor to remain the same. Additionally, newer variants of the VBScript include some code enhancements.",
