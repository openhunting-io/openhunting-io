        "description": "(IBM) One of Kegotip\u2019s main functions is scraping email addresses from hard drives of endpoints it infects, even crossing to additional partitions on the endpoint. This generates quite a handsome bounty for its operators, likely in the form of the {{Necurs}} botnet itself, which then uses these addresses in its spam runs. Kegotip has been appearing alongside {{Dridex}} and {{Locky}} infections since April 2016, either via the {{RockLoader}} or {{Upatre}}.",
