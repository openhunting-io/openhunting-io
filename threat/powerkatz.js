        "description": "(Yoroi) As intended by its name, it is able to start a new asynchronous task on the victim\u2019s machine, executing the task object passed as _app parameter. Once the task is started, the function waits its completion using repeated 1-sec sleeps cycle, and then it returns a valid code status to the function caller. Probably this module can be used in conjunction with some other functions, belonging to other pieces of the implant, to perform malicious actions in background, making all more stealth.\n\nNote: not the same software as an open source project on GitHub.",
