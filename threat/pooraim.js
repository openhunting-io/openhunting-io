POORAIM includes the following capabilities: System information enumeration, File browsing, manipulation and exfiltration, Process enumeration, Screen capture, File execution, Exfiltration of browser favorites, and battery status. Exfiltrated data is sent via files over AIM.\n\nPOORAIM has been involved in campaigns against South Korean media organizations and sites relating to North Korean refugees and defectors since early 2014.\n\nCompromised sites have acted as watering holes to deliver newer variants of POORAIM.",
