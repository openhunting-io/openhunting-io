        "description": "(FireEye) The backdoor code was ported to OS X from a Windows backdoor that has been used extensively in targeted attacks over the past several years, having been updated many times in the process. Its capabilities include a reverse shell, file listings and transfers, installation of additional executables, and an updatable configuration. The OS X version of XSLCmd includes two additional features not found in the Windows variants we have studied in depth: key logging and screen capturing.",
