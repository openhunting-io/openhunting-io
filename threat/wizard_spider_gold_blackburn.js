The Lunar Spider threat group is the Eastern European-based operator and developer of the commodity banking malware called BokBot (aka IcedID), which was first observed in April 2017. The BokBot malware provides Lunar Spider affiliates with a variety of capabilities to enable credential theft and wire fraud, through the use of webinjects and a malware distribution function.\n\nDyre has been observed to be distributed by Cutwail (operated by {{Narwhal Spider}}), as well as their own botnets Gophe and Upatre.\n\nTrickBot has been observed to be distributed via Emotet (operated by {{Mummy Spider, TA542}}), BokBot (operated by {{Lunar Spider}}), Smoke Loader (operated by {{Smoky Spider}}), DanaBot (operated by {{Scully Spider, TA547}}), Kelihos (operated by {{Zombie Spider}}), Necurs (operated by {{Monty Spider}}) and Taurus Loader (operated by {{Venom Spider, Golden Chickens}}), as well as their own botnet Gophe.",
