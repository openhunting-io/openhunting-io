Our analysts have named this Operation Honeybee, based on the names of the malicious documents used in the attacks.\n\nAdvanced Threat Research analysts have also discovered malicious documents authored by the same actor that indicate a tactical shift. These documents do not contain the typical lures by this actor, instead using Word compatibility messages to entice victims into opening them.\n\nThe Advanced Threat Research team also observed a heavy concentration of the implant in Vietnam from January 15\u201317.",
