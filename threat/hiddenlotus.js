        "description": "(Malwarebytes) So HiddenLotus didn\u2019t seem all that interesting at first, other than as a new variant of the OceanLotus backdoor first seen being used to attack numerous facets of Chinese infrastructure. OceanLotus was last seen earlier this summer, disguised as a Microsoft Word document and targeting victims in Vietnam.\n\nBut there was something strange about HiddenLotus. Unlike past malware, this one didn\u2019t have a hidden .app extension to indicate that it was an application. Instead, it actually had a .pdf extension. Yet the Finder somehow identified it as an application anyway.",
