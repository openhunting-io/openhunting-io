        "description": "(Palo Alto) In August 2017, we found this threat group has developed yet another Trojan that  they call \u2018Agent Injector\u2019 with the specific purpose of installing the {{ISMAgent}} backdoor. We are tracking this tool as ISMInjector. It has a sophisticated architecture and contains anti-analysis techniques that we have not seen in previous tools developed by this threat group. The complex structure and inclusion of new anti-analysis techniques may suggest that this group is increasing their development efforts in order to evade detection and gain higher efficacy in their attacks.",
