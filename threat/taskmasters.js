        "description": "(Positive Technologies}) The main objective of the group is to steal confidential information. The attackers attempt to burrow into corporate information systems for extended periods and obtain access to key servers, executive workstations, and business-critical systems.\n\nAt one of the attacked companies, the earliest traces of the group's presence on infrastructure dated to 2010. Since the group had obtained full control of some servers and workstations by that time, the initial breach must have occurred much earlier.\n\nMost of the attacked companies relate to manufacturing and industry. In total we are aware of compromise of over 30 companies and organizations in various sectors, including:\n\n\u2022 Manufacturing and industry\n\u2022 Energy\n\u2022 Government\n\u2022 Science and technology\n\u2022 Systems integration\n\u2022 Software development\n\u2022 Geology\n\u2022 Transport and logistics\n\u2022 Real estate\n\u2022 Construction\n\nThe group attacked companies in a number of countries. A significant number of their targets were located in Russia and the CIS.",
