FLASHFLOOD will scan both the infected system and any inserted removable drive for specific files (based on file extension or last modified time) and copy them to a specified location, using the same compression and encoding method as SPACESHIP. FLASHFLOOD may also log additional information about the victim host, including system information and data from the user\u2019s Windows Address Book.",
