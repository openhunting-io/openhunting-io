This actor focuses a significant amount of its targeting activity on entities in Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam. Heavy activity was observed in the late spring and early summer of 2014 when tensions between China and other Southeast Asian nations were high, due to conflict over territory in the South China Sea. Goblin Panda targets have been primarily observed in the defense, energy, and government sectors.",
