These two pieces of malware are designed to read and execute commands from a threat actor-controlled Telegram channel via Telegram bot. Group-IB researchers noted that all communication between the devices of the threat actors and victims was based entirely on Telegram API, and they utilized numerous evasion techniques, including Bypass User Account Control, to remain undetected.",
