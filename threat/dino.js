        "description": "(ESET) Roughly, Dino can be described as an elaborate backdoor built in a modular fashion. Among its technical innovations, there is a custom file system to execute commands in a stealthy fashion, and a complex task-scheduling module working in a similar way to the \u201ccron\u201d Unix command. Interestingly, the binary contains a lot of verbose error messages, allowing us to see Dino\u2019s developers\u2019 choice of wording. Also, a few technical artefacts suggest that Dino was authored by native French speakers.",
