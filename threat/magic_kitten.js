        "description": "(CEIP) In January 2015, the German news outlet Der Spiegel released previously unpublished documents on cyber espionage conducted by American intelligence agencies.50 One of them revealed an NSA tactic labeled \u201cfourth party collection,\u201d which is the practice of breaking into the command and control infrastructure of foreign-state-sponsored hackers to look over their shoulders. The presentation describes a real-life example of acquiring intelligence and stealing victims from a group code-named VOYEUR by the NSA, otherwise known as Magic Kitten.\n\nMagic Kitten appears to be among the oldest and most elaborate threat actors originating in Iran. It is also distinct from other groups because of its apparent relationship with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence rather than the IRGC. However, Magic Kitten\u2019s activities mirror those of other groups, with the primary targets being Iranians inside Iran and Tehran\u2019s regional rivals. The earliest observed samples of Magic Kitten\u2019s custom malware agent dates to 2007, well before other known malware apparently originated, and the threat actor continues to be active.",
