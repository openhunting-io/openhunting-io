        "description": "(SecureWorks) Dating from at least 2010, the Karagany malware family originated from criminal malware known as 'Dream Loader.' Reports indicate that Dream Loader was leaked onto underground forums and that limited use was seen in the wild.\n\nKaragany does not have a wealth of built-in capability at its core. Its main purpose is to provide the ability for a remote threat actor to maintain persistent access to a victim's network, upload/download files, and download and execute additional plugin modules.\n\nIn addition to the plugin functionality, the core module contains a limited capability to harvest browser passwords stored in the Windows Credential Store.",
