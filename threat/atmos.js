        "description": "(Heimdal Security) More than 6 months after its creator was sentenced to prison, the infamous {{Citadel}} malware resurges in a modified form, called Atmos. The new strain is currently targeting banks in France and it was also spotted being delivered with Teslacrypt.\n\nFrom {{Zeus}} to Citadel to Atmos \u2013 the years may have passed, but cyber criminals are not ready to give up on using the source code it all began with. In fact, this new Citadel variant that researchers have analyzed is modified sufficiently for it to have a new name. That\u2019s why Malwarebytes dubbed it \u201cAtmos\u201d when they first came across it.",
