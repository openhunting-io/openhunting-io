These samples began appearing in March of this year, with the majority of activity taking place within the past 3 months. The payloads vary, as earlier instances delivered {{Syscon}}, while newer instances are delivering the previously reported {{Oceansalt}} malware family. CARROTBAT and their associated payloads constitute a campaign that we are dubbing \u2018Fractured Block\u2019.",
