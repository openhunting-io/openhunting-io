        "description": "(ESET) We define Seduploader as a two-binary component, comprising a dropper and the payload usually contained in this dropper. While those two have sometimes been used independently of each other, they usually are deployed together and remain the most-used first-stage malware of the Sednit group since the beginning of 2015. The payload component of Seduploader has been compiled for Windows and OS X, but our analysisis based solely on the Windows version. Nevertheless, the OS X version is very similar, and has been described by BAE Systems in June 2015.",
