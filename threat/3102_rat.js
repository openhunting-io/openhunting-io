        "description": "(Palo Alto) On May 6 and May 11, 2015, Unit 42 observed two targeted attacks, the first against the U.S. government and the second on a European media company. Threat actors delivered the same document via spear-phishing emails to both organizations. The actors weaponized the delivery document to install a variant of the \u2018{{9002 RAT}}\u2019 Trojan called \u20183102\u2019 that heavily relies on plugins to provide functionality needed by the actors to carry out on their objectives.\n\nThe 3102 payload used in this attack also appears to be related to the {{EvilGrab RAT}} payload delivered in the watering hole attack hosted on the President of Myanmar\u2019s website in May 2015.  Additionally, we uncovered ties between the C2 infrastructure and individuals in China active in online hacking forums that claim to work in Trojan development.",
