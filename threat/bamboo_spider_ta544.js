        "description": "Zeus Panda, Panda Banker, or Panda is a variant of the original Zeus under the banking Trojan category. Its discovery was in 2016 in Brazil around the time of the Olympic Games. The majority of the code is derived from the original Zeus trojan, and maintains the coding to carry out man-in-the-browser, keystroke logging, and form grabbing attacks. ZeuS Panda launches attack campaigns with a variety of exploit kits and loaders by way of drive-by downloads and phishing emails, and also hooking internet search results to infected pages. Stealth capabilities make not only detecting but analyzing the malware difficult.\n\nGozNym has been observed to be distributed via the {{Avalanche}} botnet.\n\nZeus Panda has been observed to be distributed by Emotet (operated by {{Mummy Spider, TA542}}), Smoke Loader (operated by {{Smoky Spider}}), Cutwail (operated by {{Narwhal Spider}}) and Kelihos (operated by {{Zombie Spider}}).",
