The targets are infected using zero-click exploits via the iMessage platform, and the malware runs with root privileges, gaining complete control over the device and user data. We are calling this campaign \u201cOperation Triangulation\u201d.\n\nThis is an ongoing investigation, the amount of material we collected is substantial and will take time to analyze. Given the complexity of the attack, we are confident that we are not the only target, and invite everyone to join the research.",
