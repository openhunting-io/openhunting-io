        "description": "(Proofpoint) Philadelphia ransomware is a relatively new ransomware variant, first observed in September of last year. Designed as an easy-to-use piece of malicious software with low barriers to entry for new ransomware actors, Philadelphia is simple to customize and deploy. Although we most often associate ransomware, including Philadelphia, with large-scale, 'spray and pray' campaigns that send high message volumes to a wide spectrum of consumers and organizations, we are beginning to see significant differentiation among attacks, ransoms, scale, and even targeting.",
