This malware family was developed by the attackers themselves or was customer-made by a third party group.\n\nThe  malware impersonated Word documents, images or installation programs in the attempt to disguise itself as PDF files, pictures or Flash installers to induce the users to click.\n\nThe main purpose is to steal sensitive information from  the victims, such as system information, account & password and search history saved in the browser. It also monitors victims through Skype chatting history, cameras, microphones and keyboard & mouse logging. The information collected will then be encrypted and passed back to specific C2 servers.",
