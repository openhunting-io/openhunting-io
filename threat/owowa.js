        "description": "(Kaspersky) While looking for potentially malicious implants that targeted Microsoft Exchange servers, we identified a suspicious binary that had been submitted to a multiscanner service in late 2020. Analyzing the code, we determined that the previously unknown binary is an IIS module, aimed at stealing credentials and enabling remote command execution from OWA. We named the malicious module \u2018Owowa\u2019, and identified several compromised servers located in Asia.",
