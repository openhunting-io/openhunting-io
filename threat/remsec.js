        "description": "(Kaspersky) Remsec is particularly interested in gaining access to encrypted communications, hunting them down using an advanced modular cyber-espionage platform that incorporates a set of unique tools and techniques. The most noteworthy feature of Remsec\u2019s tactics is the deliberate avoidance of patterns: Remsec customizes its implants and infrastructure for each individual target, and never reuses them. This approach, coupled with multiple routes for the exfiltration of stolen data, such as legitimate email channels and DNS, enables Remsec to conduct secretive, long-term spying campaigns in target networks.\n\nRemsec gives the impression of being an experienced and traditional actor that has put considerable effort into learning from other extremely advanced actors, including {{Duqu}}, {{Flame}}, Equation and {{Regin}}; adopting some of their most innovative techniques and improving on their tactics in order to remain undiscovered.",
