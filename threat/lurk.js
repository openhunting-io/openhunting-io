        "description": "(SecureWorks) Lurk is a malware downloader that uses digital steganography: the art of hiding secret information within a digital format, such as an image, audio, or video file. Lurk specifically uses an algorithm that can embed encrypted URLs into an image file by inconspicuously manipulating individual pixels. The resulting image contains additional data that is virtually invisible to an observer. Lurk's primary purpose is to download and execute secondary malware payloads. In particular, the Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) research team has observed Lurk dropping malware used to commit click fraud.",
