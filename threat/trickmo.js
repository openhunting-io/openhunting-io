        "description": "(IBM) IBM X-Force researchers analyzed an Android malware app that\u2019s likely being pushed to infected users by the {{TrickBot}} Trojan. This app, dubbed \u201cTrickMo\u201d by our team, is designed to bypass second factor and strong authentication pushed to bank customers when they need to authorize a transaction.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not the first of its kind, this Android malware app is more sophisticated than similar apps and possesses interesting features that enable its operators to steal transaction authorization codes from victims who download the app.",
