We have been tracking this set of activity through our private reporting service, and we would like to provide the community with additional context.\n\nIn June 2018, we published the first report on a new cluster of activities that we named IAmTheKing, based on malware strings discovered in a malware sample from an unknown family. Amusingly, other strings present inside of it invited \u201ckapasiky antivirus\u201d to \u201cleave [them] alone\u201d.",
