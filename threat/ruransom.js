        "description": "(TrendMicro) On March 1, a tweet from MalwareHunterTeam about a possible ransomware variant caught our attention and set our immediate analysis into motion. We found several additional samples of this malware, which has been dubbed as \u201cRURansom\u201d by its developer. Despite its name, analysis has revealed it to be a wiper and not a ransomware variant because of its irreversible destruction of encrypted files.",
