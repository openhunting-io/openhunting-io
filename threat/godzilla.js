        "description": "(Check Point) Enter Godzilla Loader, a malware being advertised on Dark Web forums, and being actively developed right now. Godzilla fills the \u201cdownloader\u201d or \u201cdropper\u201d niche, offering a level of indirection such that the binary that first runs on the victim machine does not contain any of the actual payload, and instead downloads the payload from a remote server. Godzilla is actively maintained, with new features being added periodically, and retails for $500, around a quarter of the asking price of its better-established competitor, {{Emotet}}.",
