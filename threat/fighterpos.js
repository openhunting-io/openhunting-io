        "description": "(FireEye) The functionality of FighterPOS is similar to other PoS malware families we\u2019ve seen in the past. It is capable of collecting credit card track 1, track 2, and CVV codes. The malware also contains a RAM scraping functionality, commonly seen in many PoS malware families. Additionally, its keylogger functionality allows the attacker to log all keystrokes on the infected terminal. The code for the RAM scraping functionality is similar to that found in {{NewPosThings}}.",
