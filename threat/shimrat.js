        "description": "(Fox-IT) ShimRat is a custom developed piece of malware known as a \u2018RAT\u2019, Remote Administration Tool. It has among others standard capabilities for filesystem interaction.The malware was originally built in 2012 and its features were expanded over the years. The artifacts left in the first samples, are a good indicator that the project has been started in 2012. Multiple pdB paths were seen in the early versions of ShimRat. These PDB paths are not visible in the latest versions of ShimRat, due to how the samples are prepared. The PDB paths are either stripped or filled with different paths.",
