        "description": "(G Data) In February 2014, the experts of the G DATA SecurityLabs published an analysis of {{Uroburos}}, the rootkit with Russian roots. We explained that a link exists between Uroburos and the {{Agent.BTZ}} malware, which was responsible for 'the most significant breach of U.S. military computers ever.' Nine months later, after the buzz around Uroburos, aka Snake or Turla, we now identified a new generation of Agent.BTZ. We dubbed it ComRAT and, by now, analyzed two versions of the threat (v3.25 and v3.26).",
