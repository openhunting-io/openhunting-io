        "description": "(ZDNet) In most of the incidents analyzed by security researchers, the ProLock ransomware was deployed on networks that have been previously infected with the {{QakBot}} trojan.\n\nThe Qakbot trojan is distributed via email spam campaigns or is dropped as a second-stage payload on computers previously infected with the Emotet trojan. System administrators who find computers infected with either of these two malware strains should isolate systems and audit their networks, as the ProLock gang could be already wandering around their systems.",
