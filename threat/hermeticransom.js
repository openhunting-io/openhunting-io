        "description": "(Kaspersky) On February 24, 2022, Avast Threat Research published a tweet announcing the discovery of new Golang ransomware, which they called HermeticRansom. This malware was found around the same time the {{HermeticWiper}} was found, and based on publicly available information from security community it was used in recent cyberattacks in Ukraine. The new ransomware was likely used as a smokescreen for the HermeticWiper attack due to its non-sophisticated style and poor implementation.",
