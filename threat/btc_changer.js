Lazarus attacked online stores which accept cryptocurrency payments through crypto skimmers: JS-sniffers modified for the purpose of stealing crypto currency. Some victims, identified by Sansec, in fact, didn't fell prey to the clientToken= campaign, but to a different, previously undocumented Lazarus campaign, codenamed BTC Changer by Group-IB researchers.",
