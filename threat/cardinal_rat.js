        "description": "(Palo Alto) The name Cardinal RAT comes from internal names used by the author within the observed Microsoft .NET Framework executables. To date, 27 unique samples of Cardinal RAT have been observed, dating back to December 2015. It is likely that the low volume of samples seen in the wild is partly responsible for the fact that this malware family has remained under the radar for so long.\n\nThe malware itself is equipped with a number of features, including the following:\n\u2022 Collect victim information\n\u2022 Update settings\n\u2022 Act as a reverse proxy\n\u2022 Execute command\n\u2022 Uninstall itself\n\u2022 Recover passwords\n\u2022 Download and Execute new files\n\u2022 Keylogging\n\u2022 Capture screenshots\n\u2022 Update Cardinal RAT\n\u2022 Clean cookies from browsers",
